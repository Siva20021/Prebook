# Prebook - Data Hacks Project
---
Web3 based Movie Ticket Booking dApp deployed on Polygon.

### Why?
Traditional Movie ticket booking apps store user credentials like Contact Information, Credit Card Info etc. Which most of the times are leaked in a data breach due to which users may face monetary loss.

### Solution 
Our project works completely anonmysly, keeping the users data and information completely safe. We don't take any details and the movie ticket is delivered as an NFT to the users wallet.
